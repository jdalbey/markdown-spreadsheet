# Spreadsheet Viewer
View a plain-text spreadsheet in a graphical view. 

## Features
 - Can import a spreadsheet in plain-text format
 - A built-in editor with a "recalculate" feature to see instant results
 - Can read these file formats: .md, .csv, .dif, .slk, .ser
 - Will evaluate the spreadsheet formulas
 - Display a table with the resulting spreadsheet
 - Can operate in "watcher" mode where it displays a spreadsheet that is being edited by an external text editor.
 - Has a "batch" mode (non-interactive) that transforms an input file to HTML output file.

## Status
Under development.  All features above are implemented but with very little error-checking.

## Acknowledgments
This project wouldn't be possible without Ironcalc, an open-source spreadsheet engine.
